Website for Elder Dragon Bot, a League of Legends Discord Bot

# About
Elder Dragon Bot is a Bot for Discord where users are able to quickly access information regarding profile statistics, skins, champion builds and more right from Discord, removing the need to open a third-party application or website. The primary focus of Elder Dragon Bot is to provide the most common build paths for a champion in a way that is easy for the user to read, displaying skill level up order in a table-like format, as well as providing the most common rune pages in a way that the user should already be familiar with, that is, providing an imitation of the rune pages that are used within the League of Legends Client itself.

# Usage
